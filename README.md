# Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages

An interpreted language is the translation of one language into another. In this case it is the translation of the chosen language to the binary system so that the computer can read and execute it And the compiled language this directly converts the binary language when passing the compilation process and then reconstruction and is faster to execute than the interpreted languages

# Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?

The Java language is both compiled and interpreted but is compiled into an intermediate language called bytecode, which is then interpreted. Because Java developers wanted to create a compiled language, but that could run on any operating system and processor without having to create multiple executables.
